    "text": "The 1997 College Football National Champion has been an ongoing debate for years. The Nebraska Cornhuskers finished 13-0 and ranked No. 1 in the coaches poll while the Michigan Wolverines finished 12-0 ranked No.1 in the AP poll at the end of the season. This resulted in a split for the National title and lots of controversy.\nThe two teams never faced each other during that season due to an agreement with the Rose Bowl game that featured the Big Ten Champion and the Pac-10 Champion.\nThe argument has been on going for nearly 30 years now, with fans and players from both sides believing that their team would have won if the two teams played.\nThe question is, who was the real National Champion that year?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nstats1997 &lt;- read_csv(\"power_five_stats1997.csv\")\n\nrankings &lt;- stats1997 |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt; \n  summarise(Offppg = sum(Offppg)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Offppg)) |&gt; \n  top_n(10, Offppg)\n\nrankings |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = md(\"**Top 10 Highest Scoring Offenses**\"),\n    subtitle = md(\"*Nebraska is ontop of the list by a wide margin while Michigan didn't crack the top 10*\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Team = \"Team\",\n    Offppg = \"Points Per Game\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"white\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body()\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"white\"),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = \"large\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_column_labels()\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#d7191c\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#fdf2d9\", weight = \"bold\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(rows = Team == \"Nebraska\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", size = \"x-large\"),\n    locations = cells_title(groups = \"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"#383838\", style = \"italic\"),\n    locations = cells_title(groups = \"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Lukas Wortmann  |  **Source:** [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/1997.html)\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_table_lines()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 Highest Scoring Offenses\n\n\nNebraska is ontop of the list by a wide margin while Michigan didn’t crack the top 10\n\n\nTeam\nPoints Per Game\n\n\n\n\nNebraska\n46.7\n\n\nWashington State\n40.3\n\n\nUCLA\n39.8\n\n\nFlorida State\n39.0\n\n\nFlorida\n35.8\n\n\nWashington\n35.0\n\n\nKansas State\n34.8\n\n\nIowa\n34.3\n\n\nTexas A&M\n34.2\n\n\nPurdue\n33.0\n\n\n\nBy: Lukas Wortmann | Source: Sports Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska absolutely dominated the offensive scoring category putting up nearly 47 points a game, giving them a six point edge on Washington State in the second spot.\nMichigan averaged 26.8 points a game which put them nowhere near the top of the list.

They were the only team to hold their opponents to under 10 points per game. Nebraska was not too far behind them only letting up one more touchdown per game.\nWhat about strength of schedule, how difficult were teams schedules and what teams were they putting these numbers up on?\n\n\nCode\nnu &lt;- stats1997 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nmi &lt;- stats1997 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Michigan\")\n\ntn &lt;- stats1997 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Tennessee\")\n\nws &lt;- stats1997 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Washington State\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = stats1997,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = W), color = \"darkgrey\", size = 4\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = nu,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = W), color = \"#d7191c\", size = 4\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = mi,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = W), color = \"#00274C\", size = 4\n   ) +\n   geom_point(\n    data = tn,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = W), color = \"#ff8200\", size = 4\n   ) +\n   geom_text(\n    data = nu,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = W, label = Team), color = \"#d7191c\", vjust = -1, size = 2\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = mi,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = W, label = Team), color = \"#00274C\", vjust = -1, size = 2\n  ) +\n    geom_text(\n    data = tn,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = W, label = Team), color = \"#ff8200\", vjust = -1, size = 2\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, color = \"#383838\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Did a Tougher Schedule Affect the Number of Wins\",\n    subtitle = \"Nebraska and Michigan won a lot of games, but their schedules were on the easier side\",\n    x = \"Strength of Schedule (SOS)\",\n    y = \"TotalWins\", \n    caption = \"Source: SportsReference | Lukas Wortmann\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cornhuskers had the most wins during the season but their strength of schedule does not really stand out that much, as for Michigan their schedule was slightly tougher than Nebraska.\nIf we look at Tennessee, A team who had the toughest schedule of anyone that season and still produced an 11-2 record. But when they faced Nebraska in the Orange Bowl they couldn’t keep up. Nebraska won 42-17.\nFinally, let’s look at how teams actually preformed against their schedules?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nSimpleRating &lt;- stats1997 |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt; \n  summarise(SRS = sum(SRS), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(SRS)) |&gt; \n  slice_max(SRS, n = 10)\n\nSimpleRating &lt;- SimpleRating |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Highlight = case_when(\n      Team == \"Michigan\" ~ \"Michigan\",\n      Team == \"Nebraska\" ~ \"Nebraska\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(SimpleRating, aes(x = reorder(Team, SRS), y = SRS, fill = Highlight)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"Michigan\" = \"#00274C\", \n    \"Nebraska\" = \"#d7191c\",   \n    \"Other\" = \"#cccccc\"       \n  )) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Which Teams had Success Against Strength of Schedule\",\n    subtitle = \"Nebraska is once again near the top of another list\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Simple Rating System (SRS)\",\n    caption = \"Source: SportsReference | Lukas Wortmann\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14, base_family = \"serif\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, color = \"black\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 13, color = \"#666666\", margin = margin(b = 10))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple rating system is a stat that calculates a team based on their average point deferential and strength of schedule. Based off of the offensive and defensive points per game charts we could have expected Nebraska near the top of the list.\nNebraska’s strength of schedule might have be one of their only weaknesses, but that isn’t really something they can control, they did their job! They won the games on their schedule.\nSo which team would have won the hypothetical match up that year?\nLets put it this way. The Cornhuskers scored 27 or more points in every single game, while their defense only allowed more than 27 points one time, in a game remembered as “The Catch” against Missouri. We know that Michigan only averaged around 27 points a game, so would they have scored that many points on Nebraska?\nIf the two teams did face off, it would have been hard to believe that even Michigan’s defense was going to keep up with that Nebraska offense."
