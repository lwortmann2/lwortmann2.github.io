    "section": "",
    "text": "Baseball has been a sport that has been my favorite since forever. Growing up out of all of my favorite sports teams to this day the only team I have ever seen win a championship was the Kansas City Royals when they won the 2015 World Series. I have always asked my self what would happen if two champions from different years were to play each other? What would happen?\nThis Blog is going to ask the question, Which of the last 10 World Series winners had the best Performance? We will start by asking which teams were able to hit the ball well but also were able to limit their amount of strikeouts?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nWSstats &lt;-read.csv(\"C:/Users/LukasW/OneDrive/Documentos/LukasSports/lukassportsblog/posts/worldserieswinners/WSstats.csv\")\n\nteam_colors &lt;- c(\n  \"Rangers\" = \"#003278\",\n  \"Dodgers(2020)\" = \"#EF3E42\",\n  \"Astros(2017)\" = \"#002D62\",\n  \"Braves\" = \"#CE1141\",\n  \"Red Sox\" = \"#BD3039\",\n  \"Nationals\" = \"#AB0003\",\n  \"Cubs\" = \"#0E3386\",\n  \"Royals\" = \"#004687\",\n  \"Dodgers(2024)\" = \"#005A9C\",\n  \"Astros(2022)\" = \"#EB6E1F\"\n)\nWSstats$HitsPerGame &lt;- WSstats$Hits / WSstats$Games\nWSstats$SOperGame &lt;- WSstats$SO / WSstats$Games\n\nggplot(data = WSstats, aes(x = SOperGame, y = HitsPerGame, color = Team)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Team), vjust = -1, size = 3.5, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = team_colors) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Which Teams Were Able to Consitently Hit the Ball While Limiting Stikeouts?\",\n    subtitle = \"The Royals did really well making contact with the ball\",\n    x = \"Strikeouts per Game\",\n    y = \"Hits per Game\",\n    caption = \"Source:StatMuse | Lukas Wortmann\",\n    color = \"Team\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously you might know that the World Series is never the same every year. The series is a best of seven format so the same number of games are not going to be played every single year. So I decided to look at the average number of hits in each game and the average number of strikeouts each team had.\nThere a couple things I will point out. The 2024 Dodgers team this past season had the lowest amount of strikeouts with 34. The 2015 Royals were close behind with 37, the difference with the Royals is that they were also able to hit the ball consistently. They connected on 47 base hits in just five games in the 2015 series against the New York Mets, averaging them at nearly 10 hits per game.\nWe know teams were able to hit the ball, but were they able to cash in on runs when players were getting on base?\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = WSstats, aes(x = OBP, y = Runs, size = Games, color = Team)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_size(range = c(4, 12)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = team_colors) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Which Teams Succesfully got on Base and Cahsed in on Runs?\",\n    subtitle = \"The 2017 Astros scored a lot of runs while not having the best OBP\",\n    x = \"On-Base Percentage (OBP)\",\n    y = \"Total Runs Scored\",\n    caption = \"Source:StatMuse | Lukas Wortmann\",\n    size = \"Games Played)\",\n    color = \"Team\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dodgers in 2020 series had an outstanding .336 on base percentage and they are well above the rest of the teams in the pack. They were also able to cash in on upwards of 30 runs that year as well which is pretty impressive.\nOne thing that stands out to me is the difference in the amount of runs the Astros scored in their two World Series victories on this list. Everyone has there opinions on the cheating scandal they were involved in that year and obviously it is two different teams and years but it is still something to look at. The 2017 team is first in runs while the 2022 squad is last?\nNow lets take a look at how well teams played throughout the entirety of October in the Playoffs? Who stayed consistent?\n\n\nCode\nggplot(WSstats, aes(y = reorder(Team, WSAVG), x = WSAVG, xend = PlayoffAVG)) +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    size = 2,\n    size_x = 6,\n    size_xend = 6,\n    colour = \"darkgrey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",     \n    colour_xend = \"red\" \n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Did Teams Keep up Their Success Throughout the Playoffs?\",\n    subtitle = \"&lt;span style='color:Green;'&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt; = World Series Average | &lt;span style='color:Red;'&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt; = Playoff Average\",\n    x = \"Batting Average\",\n    caption = \"Source:StatMuse | Lukas Wortmann\",\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_markdown(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"#eaeaea\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic with geom_segment was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` aesthetic instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cubs are one team that stands out in this dumbbell chart because the way they were able improve their batting average in the World Series. They are one of the few teams that even had a higher batting average than the entire playoffs so they make themselves look pretty good here.\nThere’s no really say in who would win a match up if any of these Champions were to face each other but there are definitely a select few teams that standout, it would be interesting to throw all of these teams into a hypothetical playoffs and see who comes out on top but it always something interesting to look at and see how much the league is advancing and getting better over the years."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The 1997 College Football National Champion has been an ongoing debate for years. The Nebraska Cornhuskers finished 13-0 and ranked No. 1 in the coaches poll while the Michigan Wolverines finished 12-0 ranked No.1 in the AP poll at the end of the season. This resulted in a split for the National title and lots of controversy.\nThe two teams never faced each other during that season due to an agreement with the Rose Bowl game that featured the Big Ten Champion and the Pac-10 Champion.\nThe argument has been on going for nearly 30 years now, with fans and players from both sides believing that their team would have won if the two teams played.\nThe question is, who was the real National Champion that year?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nstats1997 &lt;- read_csv(\"power_five_stats1997.csv\")\n\nrankings &lt;- stats1997 |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt; \n  summarise(Offppg = sum(Offppg)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Offppg)) |&gt; \n  top_n(10, Offppg)\n\nrankings |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = md(\"**Top 10 Highest Scoring Offenses**\"),\n    subtitle = md(\"*Nebraska is ontop of the list by a wide margin while Michigan didn't crack the top 10*\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  \n  cols_label(\n    Team = \"Team\",\n    Offppg = \"Points Per Game\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"white\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body()\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"white\"),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = \"large\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_column_labels()\n  ) |&gt;\n  \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#d7191c\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#fdf2d9\", weight = \"bold\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(rows = Team == \"Nebraska\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", size = \"x-large\"),\n    locations = cells_title(groups = \"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"#383838\", style = \"italic\"),\n    locations = cells_title(groups = \"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Lukas Wortmann  |  **Source:** [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/1997.html)\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_table_lines()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 Highest Scoring Offenses\n\n\nNebraska is ontop of the list by a wide margin while Michigan didn’t crack the top 10\n\n\nTeam\nPoints Per Game\n\n\n\n\nNebraska\n46.7\n\n\nWashington State\n40.3\n\n\nUCLA\n39.8\n\n\nFlorida State\n39.0\n\n\nFlorida\n35.8\n\n\nWashington\n35.0\n\n\nKansas State\n34.8\n\n\nIowa\n34.3\n\n\nTexas A&M\n34.2\n\n\nPurdue\n33.0\n\n\n\nBy: Lukas Wortmann | Source: Sports Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska absolutely dominated the offensive scoring category putting up nearly 47 points a game, giving them a six point edge on Washington State in the second spot.\nMichigan averaged 26.8 points a game which put them nowhere near the top of the list.

They were the only team to hold their opponents to under 10 points per game. Nebraska was not too far behind them only letting up one more touchdown per game.\nWhat about strength of schedule, how difficult were teams schedules and what teams were they putting these numbers up on?\n\n\nCode\nnu &lt;- stats1997 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nmi &lt;- stats1997 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Michigan\")\n\ntn &lt;- stats1997 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Tennessee\")\n\nws &lt;- stats1997 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Washington State\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = stats1997,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = W), color = \"darkgrey\", size = 4\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = nu,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = W), color = \"#d7191c\", size = 4\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = mi,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = W), color = \"#00274C\", size = 4\n   ) +\n   geom_point(\n    data = tn,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = W), color = \"#ff8200\", size = 4\n   ) +\n   geom_text(\n    data = nu,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = W, label = Team), color = \"#d7191c\", vjust = -1, size = 2\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = mi,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = W, label = Team), color = \"#00274C\", vjust = -1, size = 2\n  ) +\n    geom_text(\n    data = tn,\n    aes(x = SOS, y = W, label = Team), color = \"#ff8200\", vjust = -1, size = 2\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, color = \"#383838\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Did a Tougher Schedule Affect the Number of Wins?\",\n    subtitle = \"Nebraska and Michigan won a lot of games, but their schedules were on the easier side\",\n    x = \"Strength of Schedule (SOS)\",\n    y = \"TotalWins\", \n    caption = \"Source: SportsReference | Lukas Wortmann\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cornhuskers had the most wins during the season but their strength of schedule does not really stand out that much, as for Michigan their schedule was slightly tougher than Nebraska.\nIf we look at Tennessee, A team who had the toughest schedule of anyone that season and still produced an 11-2 record. But when they faced Nebraska in the Orange Bowl they couldn’t keep up. Nebraska won 42-17.\nFinally, let’s look at how teams actually preformed against their schedules?\n\n\nCode\nSimpleRating &lt;- stats1997 |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt; \n  summarise(SRS = sum(SRS), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(SRS)) |&gt; \n  slice_max(SRS, n = 10)\n\nSimpleRating &lt;- SimpleRating |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Highlight = case_when(\n      Team == \"Michigan\" ~ \"Michigan\",\n      Team == \"Nebraska\" ~ \"Nebraska\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(SimpleRating, aes(x = reorder(Team, SRS), y = SRS, fill = Highlight)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"Michigan\" = \"#00274C\", \n    \"Nebraska\" = \"#d7191c\",   \n    \"Other\" = \"#cccccc\"       \n  )) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Which Teams had Success Against Strength of Schedule?\",\n    subtitle = \"Nebraska is once again near the top of another list\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Simple Rating System (SRS)\",\n    caption = \"Source: SportsReference | Lukas Wortmann\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14, base_family = \"serif\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, color = \"black\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 13, color = \"#666666\", margin = margin(b = 10))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple rating system is a stat that calculates a team based on their average point deferential and strength of schedule. Based off of the offensive and defensive points per game charts we could have expected Nebraska near the top of the list.\nNebraska’s strength of schedule might have be one of their only weaknesses, but that isn’t really something they can control, they did their job! They won the games on their schedule.\nSo which team would have won the hypothetical match up that year?\nLets put it this way. The Cornhuskers scored 27 or more points in every single game, while their defense only allowed more than 27 points one time, in a game remembered as “The Catch” against Missouri. We know that Michigan only averaged around 27 points a game, so would they have scored that many points on Nebraska?\nIf the two teams did face off, it would have been hard to believe that even Michigan’s defense was going to keep up with that Nebraska offense."
